# 💻 React mini projects
a collection of small react projects that use different aspects of react, in hope to be able to improve my coding in react and understand the concepts very well to make more advance projects in the future. 

## ✨ Technologies

react

tailwindcss


## 🚀 Components

- pomodoro timer 
- timer
- crayola colours (hex copy and paste)
- hangman
- barcode scanner (allergy checker)
- weather dashboard
- quiz
- QR code generator
- match card game
- tik tak toe
- pixel drawing
- finace management dashboard



## 📍 The Process
After completing a few projects in react, I decided to go back to basics and master the fundermentals to make future projects easier. I decided to start from simple timer projects and move to more advance ones with conditional rendering - my aim was to keep all projects to one file, to avoid these mini projects becoming too advance.
